# Notebooks

Curated notebooks for exploration, analysis, and reporting. These are intended for interactive runs rather than production training.

## Index

| Notebook | Focus |
| --- | --- |
| `analysis/analysis.ipynb` | Consolidated analysis summary |
| `bgs/bgs_rgrs_advanced.ipynb` | BGS regression (advanced) |
| `bps/bps_rgrs_advanced.ipynb` | BPS regression (advanced) |
| `bps/bps_classification.ipynb` | BPS classification |
| `pdnn/pdnn_v3.ipynb` | Probabilistic PDNN workflow |

## Notes

- Notebooks write outputs to the repo-level `results/` directory.
- Use a local Python environment with the main project requirements.
